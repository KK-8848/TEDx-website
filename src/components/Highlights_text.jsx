        architect Bijoy Ramachandran; Dr. Suman Sahai; Harish Sivaramakrishnan

        TedxCET 2022 brought a theme of "Paradigm Shift" with the intention of 
        bringing a radical difference in how we see the world around us. It made 
        us think and create a new world that existed beyond our imaginations.
